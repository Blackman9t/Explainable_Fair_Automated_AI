# IBM Explainability Master Class Hackathon
Background:
The Novel-Corona-Virus-Infectious-Disease-2019 (COVID19) which originated in Wuhan, China in Dec 2019, has spread to over 185 countries around the world and infected over 2.6 million people, with over 185,000 deaths.
See this link from the COVID19 dashboard, by the Center for Systems, Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

Common symptoms of COVID19
Patients of all ages are being infected by COVID19, whose most common symptoms include:

Coughing
Fatigue
Muscle Pain
Chest Pain
Difficulty Breathing
Pneumonia
Loss of Smell
Loss of Taste

Patients range in age from toddlers of few months of age to the elderly, with oldest reported case of about 106 years old.



Underlying Conditions that exacerbate COVID19

Researchers from the Center for Disease Control have identified certain underlying conditions in patients that aggravate the effects of COVID19 on patients, leading to severe illness or death. These underlying conditions include:-

People over the age of 65 years are more likely to develop severe illnesses or death.
People with chronic lung disease or moderate or severe asthma.
People who are immuno-compromised, These include:-

cancer treatments,
Smoking,
Bone marrow or organ transplantation
Immune deficiencies
Poorly controlled HIV/AIDS

Severe obesity

Prolonged use of corticosteroids
Diabetes
Chronic kidney disease
Liver disease

Project Goal:
The WHO has stated that up to 40% of COVID19 carriers may be asymptomatic. This is one major reason why the spread of the virus has been unprecedented and unrivalled in history. See link
Some infected people may not display compelling symptoms, yet such people are as infectious as those severely sick.
Therefore the objective of this project is to assist medical practitioners to quickly diagnose underlying conditions in patients who may be Diabetic. This will help to quickly inform those with emerging to acute levels of Diabetes to first be aware, and secondly take immediate remedies to tackle their Diabetes on time, just incase they eventually contract the Corona virus.
Early detection of underlying conditions of COVID19 will help reduce fatality rates as more people get treated for pre-conditions before exposure to COVID19.

Data:
Data Dictionary:
Kaggle-Link

Context:
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Content:
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
